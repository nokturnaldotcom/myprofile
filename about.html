        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Kassim Faisal. I am a computer engineering student at KNUST with a strong interest in robotics, IoT, and blockchain. I enjoy working on practical solutions that connect hardware and software, whether it's building circuits, coding embedded systems, or exploring decentralized technologies.</p>
        <p>My curiosity drives me to learn new concepts, experiment with different tools, and improve my problem-solving skills.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and making an impact. I tutor students online, helping them strengthen their understanding of math and science concepts. Teaching allows me to refine my own understanding while also giving back to the community.</p>
        <p>As a person, I enjoy connecting with others, exchanging ideas, and continuously learning from different experiences. I value teamwork, creativity, and perseverance in both my academic and personal pursuits.</p>
        <p>During my free time, I watch football,play football and play video games. </p>
